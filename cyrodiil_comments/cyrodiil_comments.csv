0,5,"Beyond Skyrim is so cool - love the idea of returning to familiar places 200yrs later, seeing all the changes and growth :D"
1,5,This voice actor is magnificent! This is what it looks like when your company fumbles the ball on the 90 yard line and your fandom picks it up for a touchdown.
2,5,"Bethesda should just go ahead and call this canon, the work done on this project is top notch."
3,4,"Titus Mede: ""But even then, we fought as one.""Me, having flashbacks to all the work I had to get to do to get each town to send two soldiers to the Battle of Bruma: Scuse me?"
4,5,"I'm more hyped for this than any AAA release at the moment. If every county of Cyrodiil will get the same treatment as Beyond Skyrim: Bruma, not even mentioning the storyline or any guild plots you guys might have made, this mod will become the game. This mod will be the reason for people who never played Skyrim to get it, essentially receiving two seamlessly integrated games with thousands of hours of content. Respect. Your efforts carry the heart and soul of TES modding community."
5,5,One of the greatest mods to ever grace Skyrim
6,5,doing this project and expecting nothing in return is truly heroic. I DEEPLY appreciate it.
7,5,The voice of Titus Mede II is such a perfect impersonation of the original
8,5,Soo ready for this! CONGRATS SKYRIM! 10 Years of fun!
9,5,"I can’t wait to one day have every beyond Skyrim mod in one play through, it will literally be Elder Scrolls: Tamriel"
10,5,Daniel Hodge did an amazing job as the voice actor narrating this trailer. I love all of the projects that the Beyond Skyrim team is working on. I appreciate each and every one of you that is making this project happen. I don't care how long the projects take to complete. When they are ready to be released I look forward to playing them.
11,5,"That was so nostalgic, recognising all those locations from Oblivion. I can't wait to play this! Been checking out Bruma this week and it's amazing in itself!"
12,5,I am 10x more hyped for the Beyond Skyrim projects release than I am for skyrim anniversary edition. Keep up the awesome work on Beyond Skyrim. Can we please get another stream sometime in the future?
13,5,"Damn, the video was amazingly well edited. The trasitions and scenes felt like an official stuff. I don't know if the destroyed cells will be used in game or just for the trailer but they were really well placed. The idea to present both Main Quests with a vanilla NPC strike bold and the result was great!Can't even praise enough Hodge for another taste of his gorgeous voice skillsThe soundtracks and edition, skilled as fuck!"
14,5,"So, this is an absolutely incredible feat by itself - but this has a special importance to me. When I was about 11, my best friend found Oblivion by chance at a Blockbuster. We were immediately hooked. I wasn't able to get my own copy for about a year, but we used to pretend to be in Cyrodiil during lunch breaks and make characters. We researched the game, watched all the behind-the-scenes content, read the developers blogs... This best friend of mine passed away when we were 14. So, to see the game that we spent so much time fantasising about, watching over the shoulder of the one playing on the computer, making countless notes in our journal where to find specific things... For the first time in a long time, it feels like I'm starting a new game with them watching over my shoulder. It might seem cliche, but it really does feel that way. Thank you to the Beyond Skyrim Team for making this possible. ❤"
15,5,"This was...I'm out of words, all I can say is you managed to bring a tear to my eye. Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game, seeing all these familiar scenarios feels my heart with nostalgia yet it seems so fresh, this feels me with joy, something no modern game release managed to make me feel in years. I feel exactly like I felt when Skyrim was originally released, nothing but joy, thank you for making me feel like this."
16,5,"This trailer genuinely touched my heart as An Oblivion fan. This is everything I ever wanted and I'm pretty sure at least to myself that this is the official sequel to Oblivion. I mean, this is the story I thought about in my head, dozens of times, after the White-Gold Concordiate and the Thalmor essentially taking over Cyrodiil and the aftermath of those events. This absolutely fascinates me since Oblivion is my favorite in all of the Elder Scrolls series.I cannot possibly express to you just how much I want to play this. I know it'll probably be A very long time before this project is finished. However, I can assure you when it does I will be there on day one and download it. Fantastic job all around!"
17,1,Fans put more passion in this than i've seen from any massive corporate game studio in ages. I can't wait for this. I am blown away by how sick this looks.
18,5,Bethesda: we’re releasing Skyrim re-remastered on Skyrim’s 10th anniversaryBeyond Skyrim: hold my beer
19,5,The fact that this is scheduled on Skyrim’s day is legendary
20,3,Possibly the best trailer of 2021. From a group making a mod for a 10 year old game. Like I just cannot get enough of the modding scene y'all are incredible <3
21,5,I couldnt stop smiling throughout the whole thing. This has me more excited then the anniversary edition. I'm so looking forward to this. Let our journey continue in the depths of the elder scrolls world
22,5,The voice acting is incredible
23,5,"This is insanely beautiful, everything is just perfect! You guys are the only thing keeping us sane during the ES6 wait. So thank you for putting all this amazing talent to work."
24,5,I didn’t expect this to get me a hyped as I am. It looks absolutely amazing and I’m more excited than ever. I was hoping it was gonna be another early release province but the fact it looks so great makes me hope that maybe we’ll get a release soon.
25,5,"Wow cant wait , looking forward to seeing it!"
26,5,"This is incredible, can't wait to see the end result! Great work Beyond Skyrim team, you are literal gods of the modding scene and Bethesda need to hire you."
27,5,This looks absolutely amazing! I’m building a pc specifically so I can play this. Thank you for everything you guys are doing. I wish I could contribute but unfortunately I’m not exactly talented in any form with regards to game development.
28,4,This already looks like a more complex and engaging story than Skyrim´s mainquest
29,5,"The voice acting, the script & the quality of the recording.. Not even 2 minutes in and I've got chills all over my body. This mod looks mega."
30,5,I was never waiting for Anniversary Edition. I was waiting for this <3
31,5,"Can't wait! May your road lead you to warm sands, Beyond Skyrim team."
32,5,"Beautifully done! The passion in these projects is amazing. You guys are making so many fans around the world happy with your work, thank you :)"
33,5,Huge Thank You to all the modders that are working tirelessly to bring us the Elder Scrolls content that Bethesda refuses to. It is such a bright future in Tamriel.
34,5,whoever designs and animates the logos/icons for beyond skyrim:  you ARE A GENIUS
35,1,Speechless! Absolutely unbelievable! Having logged many many hours in Oblivion the nostalgia of seeing Cyrodil again was awesome.
36,5,Beyond Skyrim you guys are absolute legends!! This is the highest quality trailer I have ever seen!
37,3,For the first time I feel like paying for something even though it's free.
38,5,Thank you for all the hard work the Beyond Skyrim team has been putting into this herculean task! I am so excited for this and all of Beyond Skyrim!
39,5,"That's amazing, my expectations where already really high but now i don't even have words, and it's free, FREE! Thank you beyond skyrim team and all other projects that made skyrim live all these years, and probably even more years from now"
40,5,"I'm super excited for Skyblivion, but for Beyond Skyrim even more. Seing all this new content and story will be mindblowing. Bruma alone was the best thing that ever happened to skyrim"
41,5,YES!! I can’t wait for the release! This is gonna be way beyond exciting!!
42,5,It was a Dragonborn that forged this empire; it must be a Dragonborn who reforges it.
43,5,Jaw droppingly AMAZING  I would pay for this to be an actual expansion on skyrim or even it's own title! Too bad this will only be for PC players. Still fantastic job you guys!
44,2,That was beyond beautiful. Keep up the good work guys! I cannot wait for the full release. I'm actually far more excited about it than I am for TES6. I kinda hoped for some sort of release date though but it's okay as it's fully understandable that projects such as this canont really have a set in stone release date
45,5,This looks so good Bethesda might have to think about making this canon before Elder Scrolls 6.
46,5,This is the most impressive project in the history of modding. You are all incredible!! Thank you for your work.
47,5,"I have goosebumps in every second looking of it, it so beautiful and tragic that i almost wanted myself to join directly taking out cyrodiil back to it's feet. Well done beyond skyrim team to bring another masterpiece of work"
48,5,"Dang this had me smiling the whole way through and gave me chills, it's looking and sounding fantastic!"
49,5,"You guys will never know how much I appreciate the time, effort and resources you're putting in this project with zero profit incentive. I love Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and cannot wait for what you do next!"
50,5,"Legendary, you guys are true heroes. This looks amazing"
51,1,I'm about to fail no nut November
52,5,It's been over a week and I still watch this trailer multiple times every day.
53,2,"I've been waiting eagerly to return to Cyrodil after hearing about the Beyond Skyrim project, and honestly, I've been more hyped about this and several modding projects more than most Bethesda announcements to date. I eagerly await to see the final product."
54,5,This was awesome! You guys did such a great job. I hope we can play it in the near future :)
55,5,The part of sheer perfection in all of this is how we all feel as players in the game and sharing the same enemy. Even if Bethesda released a final DLC for Skyrim for Hammerfell (because of the reunification of the empire and the dragon Nahfahlaar) it would’ve made for perfect storyline! But using the Great War as a main add on or if maybe the main sequence for Cyrodill is a smart use of the lore and watching this trailer gives me the excitement of playing Skyrim for the first time! This project is top tier!
56,5,so happy i was able to make it on time so happy this project is still strong cant wait to see what more you have awaiting us keep up the work hope to see this sometime before 2023
57,4,lol I think from some of these comments people think this is a release trailer but I don't see any indication of that. Happy to see what they've been working on!
58,5,This. This is exactly what I've always wanted! You guys have done such a wonderful job!!!
59,5,Beyond Skyrim is at once the hero we need and deserve.
60,5,"It is always mind blowing, watching and listening to these videos. We, as ES fans, owe all of you a huge debt of gratitude. I'm beyond excited for all the provinces and look forward to many hours of spectacular gameplay thanks to all of you 🙏🗡 🛡"
61,5,"Just amazing. Thanks so much to all of you for what you’re doing, it looks marvellous."
62,5,"This is so Beautifull its clearly got so much heart poured into it, the writing is immaculant as far as i can tell from this trailer, it made me bolth hyped and tear up as well this project is such a wonder,  its clearly going to be Better in so many ways than the base game"
63,5,I just have to say thank you for all the work you guys are doing on this project. This trailer was incredibly well made and that final line at the end gives me chills every time I hear it. I am so excited for when this project releases!
64,5,"I'm in total awe, everything you all do is breathtakingly beautiful. Happy 10th year anniversary to Skyrim too, this is quite an amazing moment to celebrate every mod too!"
65,5,This absolutely incredible! This is its own game.
66,3,"I love the mod thus far, but I really do wanna see/travel further south. I hope that this is a sign that such is coming soon.Also, it would make certain faction side quests easier since right now, areas marked by certain faction side quests are inaccessible.I'm also curious about the other projects going on, how those are coming along."
67,5,"Seeing some of the best elder scrolls youtubers, in these comments is amazing. This mod is more like an entire new game from what I can tell. This is gonna be amazing to explore. So glad it is getting the recognition it deserves. This team is doing some absolutely amazing work. Won't need elder scrolls 6 when these mods are implemented into the game."
68,5,This is so beautiful I got goosebumps and a few tears truly a masterpiece
69,5,"This is amazing! I know this work you guys are doing is so hard and its a slow process, but can we expect to see this mod soon?? And if not, will there be any new beyond skyrim content on the next year?? Take the time you need, we all thank you  your  dedication... You are the best."
70,5,"Wow, this was truly epic and breath taking. I can truly say I'm more hyped for this than any upcoming game!"
71,5,This is even more exciting than when I went Stork startling!
72,5,"Love the brilliance and continuety of making the trailer in the emperors quaters just before his assassination. His confession, regret and hope for the future. Excellent writing, can’t wait for beyond Skyrim Cyrodiil"
73,5,"This got me teary with hype, you guys do such amazing work! Thank you"
74,5,"Wow the cities look incredible, I can’t wait to explore when it releases!"
75,5,"I havent had chills from a trailer for a game in so long! And the fact that its for a mod is just amazing, Keep up the amazing work you guys are doing!!!"
76,5,"That was so epic! Loved Bruma, cant wait for the full thing"
77,5,Omg the excitement!!! Can’t wait to see where this all goes ☺️
78,5,"this looks absolutely stunning, cant wait to invest another 10 years into a game!"
79,5,"Truly a masterpiece! Everything - music, scenario, voice actors. It is something I’d rather pay for than this vaunted Skyrim: Anniversary Edition."
80,5,"This was way more exciting than the Skyrim Anniversary trailer, you're making such great progress!"
81,4,"After emerging as the famous Imperial Legate that was instrumental to the Imperial victory in the Skyrim Civil War, it’s time for the Dragonborn to pull a Napoleon on the Imperial throne."
82,5,I'm so blown away.. Truly incredible.
83,5,"This is so beautiful, I'm crying rn :')"

87,5,"This is a masterpiece, Thank you for shearing this with us I assume this will be playable on VR as well?"
88,5,Beyond Skyrim knocks it out of the park again. Amazing work as always!
89,5,"Looks really good, feels like watching a new game, or a other TES series game, it's something that i can look forward to, awesome work"
90,5,Absolutely amazing work guys. Really looking forward to this
91,5,"wow just wow. well done, awaiting this release."
92,5,Bravo to the creators of this. It got me so excited I wish it was the next game!
93,5,"Wow, I got goosebumps listening to the narration of this. Very well done it looks beautiful. 👏"
94,5,"Love the project, awesome trailer! Can't wait to play it when it's out."
95,5,"By the Nine, this is beautiful. Also, once again, the modders are doing more for TES than Bethesda."
96,5,This got me more hyped than the original skyrim trailer! Astounding work you guys!
97,5,Wow... This is bloody amazing! :) Outstanding work!
98,5,"Wow you really have done a fantastic job of what feels like a genuine continuation of the story of cyrodiil. It feels like only yesterday I was traversing the Colovian highlands towards the rubble of kvatch from chorrol, amazed by the beauty and detail of the landscape and you’ve improved on it 10 fold."
99,1,IM WAY TOO EXCITED FOR THIS. ANYONE ELSE OR JUST ME?
100,5,Absolutely beautiful. Clearly a passion project
101,5,"This is the greatest thing ever, I can't wait for the release!"
102,5,"Wow!! I'm awe struck. I'm a little bit worried about how the return of the Aylieds will play out but otherwise this mod is shaping up to be one of the finest to ever hit the scene. Keep up the great work Beyond Skyrim team, and happy anniversary!!"
103,5,"This is awesome! You all are doing the work Bethesda should have been doing all this time. As a member of the Skyrim community, I thank you."
104,3,"Damn, I had shivers running down my back, it was soooo amazing."
105,5,Damn that was so coollllllllllllllllll I’m just really sad that I know there’s still a long long long long long wait before it could be done but still thanks for the awesome trailer
106,5,"I've been planning my character around this mod where he claims the ruby throne, can't wait to be crowned emperor"
107,5,Looks fantastic you guys! I'm continually astounded by the quality of your work.
108,5,"Excellent work, guys! This turned out amazing."
109,5,I honestly hope that Bethesda wants this amazing content to become canon.
110,5,This is a trailer. And this is how you properly keep the game going for years to come. I can’t wait till more beyond Skyrim mods come.
111,5,Todd Howard: And It’s the one you’ve been waiting for😉3 years laterBeyond Skyrim: Fine…I’ll do It myself.
112,5,Yes awesome! Well done to all those who put work into this it's going to be amazing!
113,5,So well done it almost had me in tears.
114,5,Amazing! The amount of work I cannot begging to grasp for the love of Skyrim! Great accomplishment
115,5,"woohoo!, great production values and you can see these guys put a lot of sweat and tears into the work. - here's hoping it'll be out for 2022"
116,5,Really looking forward to this and all the Beyond Skyrim stories.
117,5,Emperor Tidus Mede II: Back then we fought together. Sheogorath: We did what?
118,5,That is just beautiful! Thank you for your work!
119,5,"Incredible, this is more hype than any AAA I've heard of since the Witcher 3"
120,5,So that’s what ten years feels like! Still a great game to this day
121,4,The music though it's so good and whoever is voicing the Emperor is amazing
122,3,Pretty rare when someone can perfectly mimic Wes Johnson's voice
123,3,That last line is giving me goosebumps
124,5,So cool! Congrats to the team on amazing progress
125,1,Fuck I'm legit in tears.I made a promise to ya Martin; And I intent on following it.
126,5,If you told me this was TES 6 I’d believe and welcome it Fighting Thalmor and alyieds Retaking the land we saved 200 years ago I love it honestly thank you so much for this
127,5,"What amazing trailer and feat of work you guys a doin. I can just imagine the fanfic about the dragonborn, the new dragonblood, coming back to Cyrodiil."
128,5,"This looks absolutely incredible. Your narrator, Daniel Hodge has an awesome voice. It almost reminds me of the voiceover in the Skyrim reveal trailer."
129,5,That was an amazing trailer. Someone should hire you guys
130,5,"All the praise, all the love. Long live the Empire!"
131,5,Bethesda doesnt have the interest or care to do this. It's absolutely astounding the work fans can do. I definitely look forward to playing Skyrim on PC so I can play this this looks incredible
132,5,Dude give this VA and writer medals. This gave me goosebumps
133,5,HOLY SHITTTTTTTTT THIS LOOKS AMAZING!! Exponentially more hyped for this than a soulless 'anniversary edition'.Excited to play this when it releases :)
134,5,It looks beautiful. I got chills.
135,3,i didnt realize how far this was comin along. i can't wait to see it finished.
136,1,"As someone who had his first ever Oblivion playthrough not more than a few months ago, I can now understand all the hype behind this. Absolutely crazy project, folks! Please, keep it up!"
137,4,These guys sure are good at making trailers...
138,5,"I love spending time in Skyrim. With all the mods I have it is so immersive that it feels like another world and I don't even use any mod that add needs like hunger. I also never got married, adopted a child and 2 unimportant NPCs in Whiterun have purple heads (fucked up in SSEEdit and never bothered to try fixing it). I wish I could just buy a house in Cyrodil and live there. I don't like the cold of Skyrim :)"
139,2,Should make me feel better about my mods breaking. Also people in the comments should calm down. This isn't a release trailer the way many people in the comments seem to think it is. It's just them showing off what they have been working on. BS Cyrodiil probably wont be released for another 3 to 4 years.
140,5,This makes me so hyped for the release!
141,2,I am really excited for this and I wish the team nothing but the best!
142,2,I would really love to see Bethesda make this canon. Feels way too good and ambitious not to be.
143,5,"To say we have the utmost respect about your work, is the least amount of gratitude we can show."
144,5,"Wow, I picked the right time to check back up on the project again. Amazing trailer, can't wait to see more!"
145,1,"Damn, 10 years ago I never would've expect this to happen!!!"
146,5,Looks absolutely outstanding. Fantastic job by everyone involved.
147,5,"THE HYPE IS REAL!!!! Jesus, this gave me the shivers!!! Cheers for you all making this masterpiece and my best wishes for health and perseverance in this difficult times!!"
148,5,"I never thought of it, but this thing is great ! We always saw the return of Alduin form only Skyrim's perspective, cuz normally, draugrs are supposed to be dead.It's logical that ALL the encrypted deads of the world come back with Alduin, so it's logical to see the undead Aylieds return as well !Good one :)"
149,5,I have followed your project for years and I just want to say keep up the great work👍
150,5,Well done! This was more emotional than any trailer I've seen from Bethesda.  Cannot wait.
151,2,"Waiting, the insuffarable waiting..."
152,5,"It's because of teams like beyond skyrim, and the great community of modders that skyrim is still going strong after all these years. Great job guys. I'm waiting for more updates to beyond skyrim."
153,5,"It's Beautiful... i legit have goosebumps when He say the words ""I have Failed."""
154,5,"Yo! This gave me chills, so cool!Just watched a 2nd time and Its still giving me chills! The music is on point."
155,5,I get chills every time I re-watch this.
156,1,Just been playing Oblivion and watching this gave me goosebumps. Take my pre-order money...
157,1,Bethesda been real quiet since this dropped
158,5,Brilliant. Loved every second. You guys are the best.
159,5,So cool!Feels like an anime prologue🤣Especially with that soundtrack. Some Attack on titan vibes
160,5,Love some more beyond skyrim content. If I can get the anniversary edition to ever work right again!!!
161,5,“This seat of sundered kings”Best. Line. Ever
162,4,"Wow! This video was better than some trailers I've seen for triple A games made by big studios. I'm really looking forward to returning to Cyrodiil but in modern times & seeing sights both familar & new. It'd be interesting to see what the Beyond Skyrim team have changed & whether Bethesda will deem to make it cannon eventually (either way it's bound to be awesome). I also think the story has some real potential, we don't know much yet (or at least I don't) but I like the idea of taking the fight to both the Thalmor & returning Ayleids.  I also have to say that this trailer really made me feel sorry for Titus Mede II & for what a lot of players (including me) have done to him in the past, whether he accepted it or not. He didn't have an easy decision to make to try to end the Great War but did his best under the circumstances. I don't agree with the banning of Talos however I normally side with the Empire during Skyrim playthroughs as I believe as Titus did, that we need to be united against the Thalmor for they are the true enemy of Nirn."
163,5,Thank you so much for creating this amazing mod. Like and Sub!!
164,4,Can't wait for it to finally be released... I just hope it will work without the problems we currently face with the latest update and the AE
165,4,I just Wonder what Bethesda has to say about this fine work
166,5,well done to all the team! <3
167,5,thats great . I love Beyond Skyrim <3   you guys making a very good job
168,5,I’m so exited for this!! This is the closest we’ll get to tes6 for a long while
169,5,"Fucking yes, I love fighting the Thalmor. Skyrim has turned fighting the Thalmor into my favorite hobby."
170,5,"Omg. You guys are the best! Can't wait for the release, I hope it may happen in 2022 :)"
171,3,"This almost certainly isn’t a release trailer but by some freak miracle it is, that would be great"
172,4,Can't wait to see some reaction videos on this epic trailer. BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS!
173,1,i wish i could send this video back in time to myself a few months after skyrim's initial release
174,5,Looks beautiful fellas. All I can say is keep up the good work.
175,5,"what you people are doing, is just incredible, thank you so much"
176,5,"Dude, this is so awesome..!!Bethesda needs to take a seat and see how it's done .  They've been doing is profiting from the same game over and over again while better developers are creating amazing work"
177,4,I’m still waiting very patiently for a release window for this project or any project of that matter. Surly roscrea is nearly done.
178,5,This looks freaking awesome.
179,5,Fuck Anniversary edition I love Legacy of the Dragonborn and beyond Skyrim. Now this is looks dope AF.
180,4,"I've been following this mod since 2013. I remember being so excited for it thinking it'll be out within a year or 2 tops. Boy oh boy. I don't play Skyrim anymore, and I probably won't go back to it. But I still respect the fact you guys are still working on it. The videos are cool to look at. But I don't see this as something anyone will play anytime soon. I see this as just youtube content from a bunch of hardcore fans. And I respect that."
181,5,"Why did you put this trailer, man!? Now I want MORE!!I can't wait to play this mod. It looks astonishing!!Great job by all of the team!"
182,5,"I am so happy to be born in a time where this project exists. When the entire project comes out, no one will ever see me again."
183,5,"This looks incredible, wow. Lets go, cannot wait to play this."
184,5,"Finally, a game actually worthy of paying full price"
185,5,Hype.This is like the big thing for me now not Elder ring or whatever... You guys are monsters letting us with the intrigue. By Azura By Azura by Azura... It is Beyond Skyrim Cyrodil.
186,1,THIS LOOKS SO OFFICIAL I CANT BELIEVE ITS „JUST“ A MOD 😩😩😩😩💕
187,5,I do wish I could get the anniversary edition of Skyrim but this looks awesome !!!!!!
188,4,"It's evidently clear you guys love your craft speaking as a writer of fantasy and science fiction, I have much respect for those who love their craft and do it well. You have intrigued me as to what is in here."
189,5,"""The people will have to protect themselves they must find something, anything, to hold onto, and then give their lives in service to it.""  Sounds like the perfect time for 'ol Dovahkiin and his loyal cohort of dovah to grace Cyrodiil with his presence.  I could see it now...the warlords of Cyrodiil marching their armies to the Imperial city and the dragonborn pulling a Game of Thrones-esque dragon ambush out of nowhere."
190,5,I wish I could like this AGAIN after watching the rest of it! Thank you for sharing! I am ready!
191,3,Waaaaay better news than AE
192,4,This really feels like a proper sequel for Skyrim's story
193,5,This looks phenomenal!
194,5,"Amazing, only thing that could made it better would been a release date :)"
195,5,"If Bethesda had a team like you guys, we would never need mods anymore. So complete, wonderful, and super creative. Congratulations, the project Beyond Skyrim is really powerful! <3"
196,1,I'm so excited for this project! Planning to donate to it come payday!
197,5,"Oh boy, can't wait to play this game in 2048!"
198,5,Wow they made the Anvil dams canon! That was one of my favourite areas from unique landscapes
199,5,"OH BOI, OH BOI. I'm hyped! ❤️"
200,4,"Looks amazing, I can't wait for it to be released. Aw man, now I really want to play Skyrim again, but the update broke SKSE T_T my mods, my precious precious mods. Maybe ill go install MW again and check out Tamriel Rebuilt.2:43 really shows off how nice Skyrim looks running on a Smart Fridge. you can almost count the pixels in that ground texture and get paper cuts from the edges on those lighting effects. lol, no hate, it just was funny how out of place it looked."
201,5,"Freaking awesome, can't wait to revisit cyrodiil"
202,1,Damn! I'd say this is probably a higher quality trailer than what most Fantasy GAMES released. Kudos and keep the work going
203,5,By the nines this looks incredible! Now I know how that Argonian maid felt 😍
204,5,For the glory of the Empire. Long live the Emperor. Long live the Empire.
205,4,Been waiting to see how Kvatch fared after the oblivion crisis.
206,5,Got up from my seat and gave this a standing ovation.
207,5,hopefully the anniversary addition wont break this awesome mod. i need to play this!
208,1,This is like a breath of fresh air especially after the last big mod project I was excited for was an utter disappointment cough frontier cough
209,5,Fucking lit. You guys did so good. The exterior spaces look amazing.
210,4,Seeing the cities expanded to so cool! I think they probably would have expanded since Oblivion
211,3,I will probably die before any more beyond skyrim content comes out
212,1,Sold!!Oh... wait. Its free!You guys are doing Talos's work! Massive respect to the team and contributors. I look forward to playing it.
213,4,"A-mazing. Since bruma I have been wondering how cyrodil will be and from this trailer, it's going to be a blast for the ages."
214,5,Such a BIG and COOL and CREATIVE and PASSIONED project. Can’t wait to play it in a couple of years - when I have time and a strong enough pc to play it then.
215,5,Beyond amazement to see how far this has come. If only I had a PC…
216,5,"God it's gorgeous, I already explored BS: Cyrodill in an earlier leaked build but this is even better!"
217,5,HYPE!
218,1,Played Beyond Skyrim: Bruma in 2017. Look forward to play all of Cyrodiil in this. Looks sick!
219,1,I am so excited
220,4,"Great trailer. The voice actor is pretty damn good too.Although, I'm rather annoyed at the wait time, to a degree, that all my hype died long ago."
221,1,"I swear to go god if there is no mention of the Beyond Skyrim Team in TES6 I’ll riot.You guys are legitimately producing studio-grade content that Bethesda should be making. If you really manage to get Cyrodiil out before TES6, there needs to be some Easter egg there of a secret faction striving to unite Tamriel."
222,2,I cant wait for the cathartic experience of walking around old oblivion gates and the imperial city.
223,5,I feel sorry for the Emperor he is such a nice dude
224,1,If I can side with the Thalmor. You’ll have officially beat Bethesda at their own game… literally
225,1,I am fully willing to pay 60 bucks for this even though they're not charging anything
226,5,I absolutely LOVE the remnants of the oblivion gates.
227,5,Amazing trailer! How am I transported to 2006 & yet it's 2021. Warp in the West nostalgia levels
228,1,I am infinitely more excited for this alone than I am for even an ES6
229,5,I can't wait! I hope it works with anniversary edition
230,5,"This and hundreds of other examples is why a heavily moddable game will always keep a healthy community around it to create amazing things, but Bethesda is lucky enough to have some of the most impressive and skilled people working on their games.Truly amazing, keep up the great work guys! Wish you nothing but the best in this and future projects!"
231,5,Watching this for the thirty time now
232,5,I can't believe that 🥺💜 this is piece of art
233,5,"Finally, someone who make sense enough to bring the fight against the Thalmor"
234,5,This is so fucking epic!!! Never been more excited about any video game release.
235,5,This is incredibly amazing!!!!!!
236,5,Daniel Hodge’s portrayal of Emperor Mede is perfect
237,1,Wonder if we will get a sneak peak at any of their super followers
238,3,"I am suffering with crippling depression...but this, does put a smile in my face."
239,1,"First Project Mojave, now this??? Real???"
240,5,"Been waiting for this since Bruma. The flames of hope still burn - let me go back, my Cyrodiil needs me!"
241,5,Breath taking OST man great job to the devs
242,4,"Hope this narrative will work together well with TES6, either way it looks extremely high quality and I can't wait to see it"
243,5,"This is so cool. And yet, I cannot hide a feeling that Bethesda (or whatever) will one day take all of this hard work and sell it under their own name - like Skyrim Century Edition or something. Wish all the best to You, guys! =)"
244,5,I was waiting for this more than the anniversary edition
245,3,"By Azura, could it be true?"
246,3,Seeing the emperor get some more story should be cool.
247,3,Beyond Skyrim is more honest then Bethesda could’ve ever possibly be these days
248,5,This is one of the best game trailers ever
249,5,"Cyrodiil in Creation Engine is a dream that you don't wanna wake up from, and a heroic life you have to fight for."
250,5,This mod is much cooler than the official anniversary edition. SUPPORT!!!!
251,1,Can I have this instead of anniversary edition please?
252,5,wow yall really hit the vibe i got nostalgia chills
253,5,I am fucking excited to finally see the mod. You guys are awesome
254,5,"This is a very good trailer, top tier quality"
255,4,"Man I am SO HYPEDHearing Titus Mede narrate this trailer is epic, he does a better job than Uriel. I can really feel this trailer, feels like a movieIt does make me wonder, however......how does this affect the brotherhood questline ..... and vice versa"
256,1,This trailer got me into tears.
257,3,im hoping there is an option for the dragonborn to take the throne instead of chooseing a count.
258,5,"Beyond Skyrim and TES Renewal teams are killing me with so much anticipation, I CANT WAIT!!!! 🤩🤩🤩"
259,3,"Okay, with this there is, quite understandably, hype, and hope that it'll be releasing soonso looking on the Beyond Skyrim website...linked everywhere, and under Cyrodiil, there is no commitment to a release windowhowever it also states world building is nearly complete, however voice acting, implementation and testing will take some timewith all this information, I'd say the absolute EARLIEST we can get is end of 2022, start of 2023however a much more reasonably time fram would be end of 2023, start of 2024, assuming there's no engine breaking bugs of course"
260,3,I would LOVE to help in any capacity but i don’t know if i have a decent enough rig. To the team; keep up the good work.
261,2,I got chills like when I was listening to Ulfric's speech
262,5,Looks amazing!
263,3,"By the looks of it, it shouldn't be too much longer (relatively speaking). Hyped as hell."
264,5,this trailer just bkew me away. Really good job on everyone working in that humungus projekt. Screw Anniversary Edition I want THIS
265,3,But does it support fishing?
266,5,"Beyond Hype!Take the time you need guys n' girls, if Bruma was any indication, what we've seen so far of the heartland will be worth any wait :D"
267,5,This is my elder scrolls 6! Cannot wait for this to release!
268,3,Good voice acting. Really excited for this.
269,5,"that was an epic trailer, holy hell!"
270,5,"HOLY MOTHER OF TALOS!!!!!The last time I was this hyped, Emperor Uriel Septim the 7th was still alive & a Dragon saved my ass from the headsmen! :D"
271,5,"I am crying tears of joy, as a parent would cry when he sees his child graduate university or getting marriedThe Beyond Skyrim team is nothing short of Legendary"
272,2,"Honestly, the quality and professionalism of the Cyrodiil project is so high, Bethesda should make it canon and hire/buy the project when it's complete and allow its sale. Kinda like what Valve does."
273,5,Now this is the Skyrim I'm looking for!
274,5,Ik this is a small detail. But that amulet of kings logo is genuinely cool as hell. Like 100/10 design. I love it.
275,5,Cant wait! Youre doing gods work
276,5,incredible how trailers made by loyal fans actually get me more excited than whatever garbage corporations can spew up
277,1,The Beyond skyrim team makes bethesda look like shit lmao
278,5,"Bruma, Chorrol, Cheydinhal, Leyawin, Skingrad, Bravil, Kvatch, and the Imperial City. BRING THEM AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL BACK!! I'm having goosebumps for this project of Beyond Skyrim: Cyradiil!!Nothing but RESPECT for you guys in the Beyond Skyrim group. UssThere is a mod for High King of Skyrim, then got down to Cyradiil and start paying the Thalmor a serious visit."
279,1,Lol this is cant be real o_o
280,1,I’m literally shaking and crying someone get these elves out of the Heartland.
281,3,It sounds to me as if it's high time to have a Dragonborn back on the Ruby throne.
282,5,"1:52""I for one, welcome our new Thalmor Overlords"""
283,3,This needs more hype than the Skyrim Anniversary Edition. This has more potential.
284,5,Anyone else feels sad for Titus Mede II after THIS incredibly beautiful speech?
285,2,"The first 10 dislikes are from Lexy, Phoenix Flavor lady, Arthmoor, Giskard, Sinitard, Nether Follower Framework guy, Fores, Enaisiaion, Apollodown, and Tarshana.The rest of the dislikes from now on are LE and console users lol"
286,1,It looks so goood i got chills!
287,1,This trailer gave me chills.
288,3,"I'm suprised at the heavy thalmor presence, as the lore in Skyrim seems to state that they have a much smaller presence there than in Skyrim."
289,5,well made. good job. and keep helping to rebuild cyrodiil.
290,1,That soundtrack gave me goosebumps. I'm so excited
291,4,"I remember when the prerelease came out in 2017. Hype was pretty high, but even more vividly than that, I remember a bunch of people telling others to calm their expectations because this mod was likely not going to be out until 2021-2022 at the latest. I thought to myself ""damn, that's a long time from now."" Here we are, 4 years later, and those guys were wrong lolI don't know where I'm going with this. I suppose my hot take is to trust no one, not even the devs, in regards to there actually being a release date. Nobody knows.As a bonus, Roscrea and Atmora have been ""almost ready"" for 4 years now lol"
292,5,"You guys should really send curriculums to Bethesda after this, you rock"
293,5,Long live the Emperor! Long live the Empire!
294,4,I was hoping to see a bit more of the return of the aeylids but this was still a great trailer
295,5,This looks amazing
296,5,A decade of work. Man that’s cool to see.
297,1,PLEASE TELL ME BEYOND SKYRIM. release date early 2022.
298,3,"I'd be curious to see where they're at percentage wise in terms of completion to launch. I know that wouldn't give a time frame for it, but I'm curious nonetheless."
299,3,I think the title is confusing as to what this video was actually going to be
300,5,This looks amazing
301,1,"Why tf did I start tearing when I saw all the provinces.... fucking hell, so hyped. Thank you modders"
302,5,It almost feels like Bethesda is the Thalmor at this point and we truly do need to drive them out... together
303,5,This is so impressive!
304,2,It's going to feel like an elder Scrolls 5.5 and I cant wait
305,5,they really doing more than bethesda on skyrims 10th anniversary
306,5,Not even released yet and already the best mod project to grace this game
307,5,"For me, this is The Elder Scrolls 6. And it will be the greatest of all time"
308,1,"I'm absolutely losing it, this is incredible!!!!!!!"
309,5,I'm so excited for this! Been wanting to bash some Thalmor skull in since Skyrim came out. 😅
310,5,holy shit this is a great trailer :O i got goosebumps!
311,3,:O
312,5,This is way too epic!!! Let's go!
313,5,That..was an awesome trailer!
314,5,This trailer gives me goose bump.
315,2,In the first minute it says the people wanted to continue and finish the war. A book in Skyrim actually says that there would have been revolts if the emperor tried to keep fighting because everyone was tired of the war and wanted it to end.
316,1,Dude imagine if a AAA game company could make games as fast as indie mod devs.
317,1,"Todd Howard dislikes this.Edit: Shit, now 19 Todd Howards dislike this."
318,3,"This is what I have thought the ""Dragonborn"" DLC for Skyrim should have concerned. Perhaps not on this grand a scale, but it should have concerned the Kingship over Skyrim and a campain to defeat the Thalmor. Not a fight with another Dragonborn (Miraak). Perhaps he could have appeared to you from Sovngarde in a dream to tell you of another part of your destiny and what you had to do to achieve it."
319,5,holy moly this looks amazing.
320,3,You know we hear bethesda talking - the future and so. 15 years huh ? Its kinda crazy that talented people who once were gamers are now maintaining the universe.
321,4,"I like how this implies (lore-wise at least) that the db could take over as the new emperor, Tiber-style."
322,5,Now this is something to look forward to.
323,5,Truly amazing!!
324,5,And that is how you make a trailer. Special props to the voice acting.
325,5,This is so wonderful
326,1,Literally got chills from this
327,5,"Beyond Skyrim, Skyblivion, and Skywind. So hyped for these"
328,5,Only a true dragonborn emperor can reclaim the lost glories of the empire. All hail Emperor Ysmir the dragon of the North!
329,4,"If Bethesda had any real business sense, they would hire this team immediately and make the entire Elder Scrolls segment of the company theirs to manage/direct."
330,1,"This will absolutely mop the floor with Bethesda's ""Anniversary Edition""."
331,5,"4:01 tiddy spottedAll jokes aside, this truly is incredible. Even if I may not be able to play it with my current hardware, I appreciate your immense effort nonetheless. Talos guide your kind souls."
332,3,"Im just imagining how cool it would be for your dragonborn character to travel to Cyrodill and help drive the Thalmor out. I know it probably wont be the dragonborn, but its a neat thought."
333,5,When you meet him again after killing him 200 times.Aw sht here we go again.
334,5,I think I’ll have to finally play oblivion to prepare myself for this
335,5,Я верю в вас. Хочется дождаться финала вашей работы.
336,5,Holy shit. This trailer ist beyond my imagination. It's incredible what u have done yet.
337,5,Just... Wow. That's all I have to say. Thank you all so much.
338,5,"This has got to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, community project ever - please open a Patreon for this game. The community created it, the community shall give to it. Kudos to the entire team simply for the vision of this project."
339,5,Looking forward to this and the Illiac Bay project. Can't wait.
340,5,Im 30 seconds into this and I had to pause and comment. I need this kind of energy and vibe for the new skyrim. Feels like GOTs.
341,5,Im just wordless... Amazing that you actually do this😇
342,5,Crazy how this is way more popular than the 10-year anniversary release of the actual game! XD
343,5,Looks awesome!
344,5,The Perfect Story Telling Voice ! AMAZING !
345,5,"So, awesome. Can't wait."
346,5,Wow that was spectacular!!!
347,3,I dont even know what this is but it's making me wanna replay skyrim and wishing it was a DLC to the game.
348,5,This is amazing!!!
349,4,"It you had the opportunity to bring Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil to the Creation Club, would you? Because of you did I would pay for it in a heartbeat."
350,4,I love that this trailer is supposed to be or I am assuming set right before the Dark Brotherhood kills Emperor Titus Mede II and the trailer has Titus Mede II reflecting on his failures as leader of the Empire along with hopes and fears about the future of the Empire?
351,5,THIS IS INCREDIBLE!
352,5,You have my full and undivided attention.For the Empire.
353,5,For the Empire! For Cyrodiil!
354,1,"Can't wait to return to Cyrdiil, I miss Martin..."
355,1,I just want Skyrim to turn into arena so bad just literally go anywhere and quest in every province i think that’s Skyrim’s max potential
356,5,Very epic trailer. Nice work team.
357,5,This mod will make the Dragonborn from a local hero to a continental hero
358,5,Me watching this trailer0:01 - 4:00 : Wow so cool 😲4:01 : Nice 😎
359,5,Great work!!!
360,5,This mod looks amazing. I may have to dig up one of my old characters for when this mod comes out where I was roleplaying as the champion from Oblviion who had been turned into a vampire while looking for a daedric artifact to give to Martin (inspired by my first play through of Oblivion). The idea of going back to Cyrodil as the Champion (not necessarily the Dragonborn) to set things right and restore the empire sounds awesome.
361,1,"Time to fight the Ayleids again? If so, then damn I'm hyped."
362,5,Imagine having passion for these games. I'm absolutely livid that this is free.
363,1,"How can I show my appreciation damn, this isn't just a mod anymore"
364,5,Thank You. This really makes my day.
365,4,the funny thing to me is that by all imperial law your char in skyrim can by right of blood claim the throne if we got hold of another amulet of kings we could relight the fires and no one could dispute that our char was the rightful ruler of the empire and the thalmor would most likely run back to sumerset and given that we would of also rebuilt the blades and if we relight the dragon fires the legions would be with us as one force and im pretty sure the other races that were forced to join the thalmor would be aswell we could see in the next game a new united empire due to the events of and after skyrim
366,1,This looks beyond incredible! Can't believe this looks better than if Bethesda themselves did it. Simply can't wait to try this out!!!
367,2,I thought it was just a remake of Oblivion but this sounds like a sequel to it? My hype just skyrocketed for this
368,5,"Well, I'm still hyped for this!"
369,1,"I swear, even just the premise of the ayleid return and the succession crisis, Bethesda should officially license this project.I'd pay money to play it if it meant it was canon"
370,4,"The AE update destroyed my mods and saves, but I'm still hyped for this."
371,3,So can't wait. The hype is real.
372,5,FOR THE EMPIRE! ✊ may we do Martin’s sacrifice honour!
373,4,"This is great and I love it, but I'm starting to get major Bannerlord vibes from you guys. Thanks for your hardwork tho."
374,5,This is the best trailer I have ever seen.
375,5,Holy shit that gave me goosebumps in Good way!
376,5,Looks amazing
377,1,"""Halt right there Citizen, it's dangerous to go alone, here take this"" pickpocket skooma into citizens pockets-Me as a Riten Guard"
378,5,This has the passion Todd and the team had back during Morrowind before they became corporate shills. Keep the spirit alive yall
379,3,That mace/imperial dragon/red diamond logo animation at the end was clever
380,1,they really made dirty my man Titus. He did basically save humanity
381,5,i really hope to be able to play this soon
382,2,"Do not become discouraged, please. Far more people are waiting anxiously for this than the likes and views shown on YouTube. Keep it up, please. (I would love to help but I do not have experience in modding. Not even in the slightest.)"
383,5,Happy Skyrim Anniversary. Skyrim Anniversary Edition drops same time as this trailer.
384,4,"Hopefully Skyrim Anniversary Edition doesn't mess up the building of this project.Hopefully you all will keep working on this even after TES VI comes out. You have 4 massive dedicated teams of modders all working to achieve one goal, to allow players to explore other provinces and check out the various cultures and landscape that Tamriel has. In fact, ya'll should explore the possibility of making your own game after this project does get completed."
385,5,"Just imagine, Apotheosis + Beyond Skyrim, being able to travel through all Tamriel AND all the planes of Oblivion, that would be amazing. Fuck TESVI, these two giant mods will give to us months for play."
386,5,"oh oh oh give it to me now. trailer was excellent so professional, looked like a trailer from BGS."
387,5,The Voice acting is just wow.
388,3,When a group of fans make a better game than Bethesda:
389,5,"The Beyond Skyrim Bruma mod was great, this looks like it will be too.  The narrator goes a great job sounding like Patrick Stewart."
390,5,"Bethesda may vomit out all the unchanged, unfixed Skyrim re-releases it pleases to. This is what I am excited for."
391,3,"Wow, the voice is almost spot on.However, Septims didn't rule for ""milennia"" as old Titus here claims."
392,5,This is just... EPIC
393,5,"All hail the Emporer, all hail the Empire!"
394,4,A group of fans contribute more to the story and development of TES (albeit non-canon) for free than anything Bethesda have done in 10 years.
395,1,this gave me chills
396,5,Its amazing!
397,5,"Hopefully a few years from now, I’m playing this."
398,5,best mod project in gaming history hands down.
399,4,"Dayum, that got me going. Looking forward to slaughtering some thalmor with my Argonian Rogue"
400,5,That voice acting ❤❤❤
401,5,"Chills, straight chills!"
402,5,"Imagine if one day, all of Tamriel can be explored from Skyrim"
403,5,Long live the Empire!
404,2,"Trailer looks amazing but gotta be honest, not being able to become the emperor yourself is a huge let down for me and seems like a huge missed opportunity. It's more sad too since the trailer seems like its implying you can become the emperor but the website says you cant   Big L for otherwise great looking Mod"
405,1,real hyped to try this in VR
406,1,I’ll probably be old as fuck by the time this mod releases and I’ll still download and play it
407,5,Will they consider this canon because I really hope they do!
408,5,Now I want to join the imperial
409,1,They should make every single province of tamriel with skyrim graphics. And make it a one single game.
410,4,I want to know how this will link in with beyond bruma. Will it unlock the boundary blocks that are currently in place 🤔 unlock the rest of cyrodiil. Or will it be a complete new landscape
411,3,"This all looks amazing, but the guard armours look a bit strange and look much lower quality than most of the other content in the mod, really strange contrast"
412,4,I really wish Bethesda would see how much the fans love oblivion and properly remaster the game
413,5,A dream come true...never thought I'd see it
414,5,Excellent job as always
415,5,"yes,that is really so cool.can't wait anymore👍"
416,5,Hyped for it!
417,5,"Incredible work. Absolutely incredible. I'm more excited for this, and more faithful that it will be worth the wait, than I am for The Elder Scolls VI."
418,5,"“Whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch the magic!”"
419,1,By the 8 you guys are never given enough credit!
420,2,I'm more excited for stuff like this than Starfield
421,4,"This is so awesome. But looking at the website, it says it will be available for Skyrim SE and AE. Does this mean it will not be available for Standard/Legendary edition? :("
422,1,Can't wait for the releaseee !!
423,4,Me: I'm getting the feeling of nostalgiaFlashbacks to Elder scrolls 4 Oblivion
424,1,""" some plan to usurp me even now "" me killing the pentus oculotis just outside the room as he writes his speech"
425,2,feels like a total conversion to Skyrim than its own separate title.
426,4,I hope they include the sanctuary in Cheydinhall
427,5,"‘We fought together as one’ Didn’t the Hero of Kvatch go in 40 different portals himself to close them? 💀 Great trailer tho, amazing work"
428,5,"Akatosh blesh Beyond Skyrim, this is absolutly awesome!"
429,3,Ok I am so hyped for this.
430,2,this is more hype than any other elder scrolls to date
431,5,bethesda need to hire you this looks like a legit dlc trailer for skyrim.
432,3,"Cyrodill is cool an all. But, I am excited for the more exotic settings like Black Marsh and Elsweyr."
433,5,"let's be real, beyond skyrim will be done, polished, and expanded upon twice over before VI gets released"
434,5,I just want to listen to this song on repeat
435,1,the Emperor: we need to drive the thalmor back! me: hmm Pelinal Mk 2 would be an idea
436,2,"The Thalmor shuddered, for there was a storm building in the north....."
437,5,Holy shit this was good. I already have Beyond Skyrim Blue Balls.
438,5,epic trailer great job guys
439,3,Hey i was wondering how would you be able to fast travel from all the places because loading to each pass will take a while?
440,5,Really love this unique looking undead mers
441,5,"OMG yes this is amazing, i hope my PC can run it"
442,5,"If only Bethesda/Microsoft were smart enough to fund this project, accelerate its completion, I would gladly pay real money for this."
443,4,"This is really awesome, but seems to imply that the emperor will be involved in this mega mod... how do you square that with the Dark Brotherhood quest line?"
444,5,This looks so awesome it makes me sad it will never release lol
445,5,Can’t wait 🔥
446,1,It is one hell of a interesting thing that Blades had the aylids return and then Skyrim AE has The Mythic Dawn and the aylids returning and now Beyond Cyrodill has the aylids returning.....Ah yeah it is all coming together
447,3,"Brilliant audio, visuals and voice work.The writing for this monologue, however, has been written incredibly poorly.Many redundancies and a fair degree of what’s just generally poor grammar. If this writing is supposed to be in the mod, please consider streamlining and tightening it up considerably.Other than that, the voice actor did remarkably well to emulate Sir Patrick Stewart’s voice. Well done to him and everyone else for all of their efforts.Very exciting times ahead!"
448,4,"Is it possible to know the name of the soundtrack? I checked the description and didn't find it, sorry if the question is stupid but I am in love with that music"
449,3,Im more hyped for this than for TES VI. Im pretty sure Bethesda will screw it up anyways so this is might be the true next TES.
450,3,Can't wait <3
451,5,"Once more, the Tharns shall rule the Empire!"
452,1,The fact that people have literally made their own versions of Skyrim or renewed old Elder Scrolls games while TES 6 still hasn't released kinda says something
453,3,I am wondering if there are any other mods recommended to run with this mod
454,5,By. The. NINE.This looks/sounds/feels GLORIOUS!!!!
455,2,Is it bad that I’m more excited for any new Beyond Skyrim releases than TES6?
456,2,for real con we all pay for this to come out a lot faster?
457,5,Wow! The voice actor is better than the ones in skyrim.
458,2,10 times better then bethesda's trailers XDDDAlso there is something new instead of a reskin XDD
459,5,WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!? THIS IS AMAZING!!!
460,5,Now imagine shivering isles in Skyrim quality 👀
461,2,Will there be an option to side with the Thalmor?
462,2,"It's too bad this is gonna be way too big to happen on console. Good luck PC players, this looks like it's gonna be epic."
463,4,"Dark Brotherhood assassin: ""Wow, bro. That speech was pretty epic... WELP TIME FOR MURDER."""
464,3,So this must have been what tulius was talking about with the revolt plans
465,1,Can’t wait for this too release
